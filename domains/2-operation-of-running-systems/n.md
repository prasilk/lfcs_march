## Use scripting to automate system maintenance tasks

A bash shell script:

- begins with a shebang (`#!/bin/bash`) which tells the operating system which interpreter to use to parse the rest of the file
- contains a series of commands or/and typical constructs of imperative programming
- is usually associated with the `.sh` extension
- must be executable: `chmod +x <file>.sh` 
- can be executed by typing: `./<file>.sh`
